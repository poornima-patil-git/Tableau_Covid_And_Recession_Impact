# Covid(2020) &amp; Recession(2007-2009) impact on Unemployment and Personal Income

**Project Overview :** This project presents a set of interactive visualizations to analyze and compare the impact of two major global events - the Great Recession (2007 - 2009) and the COVID-19 pandemic (2020) examining their impact on various aspects of the U.S. economy. The analysis focuses on key economic indicators such as unemployment rates and Personal income across selected states: Texas, California, and New York.

**Key Visualizations :**

**Unemployment Rate:** A comparison of unemployment rates before, during, and after the Great Recession and COVID-19.

**Personal Income:** How personal income was affected by both crises.

**Data Sources :** The data used in this project is sourced from:

**FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data):** https://fredhelp.stlouisfed.org/

**Data visualization and Data Tools :**

  1. Download the Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx) file from this repository.
  
  2. Open the file using Tableau Desktop.
  
  3. Interact with the dashboards to analyze the impact of the Great Recession and COVID-19.

**Insights & Conclusion :**

**Unemployment Impact:** Unemployment declined steadily to around 4–5% in all three states before COVID, reflecting strong labor market recovery since 2010. Both the 2007–2009 recession and COVID caused sharp unemployment spikes, with California and New York hit harder than Texas. Texas experienced comparatively fewer job losses and faster recovery in both periods. Post-COVID, unemployment fell quickly across all three states, indicating a strong rebound.

**Personal Income Impact:** All three states show a steady rise in income over time, with California and New York consistently higher than Texas. Income growth slowed during the 2007–2009 recession and dipped briefly during the COVID period, though Texas was less affected than CA and NY. Post-recession and post-COVID periods show renewed income growth across all three states, indicating strong economic recovery.
